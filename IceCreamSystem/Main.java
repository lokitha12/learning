package IceCreamSystem;
/*
                  **** Basic Program ****
* create 3 Entities: Customer,coneIcecream,cupIcecream
* customer knows ; flavor,Icecreamtype  \\ unknown ; orderId,price
* coneicecream & cupicecream knows ;orderId,price \\ unknown ; flavor,Icecreamtype
* and create constructor with params and one empty constructor(default) for both cone and cup.
* then the method are orderIcecream( string flaovor) inside method sets price cone :80,cup:40 then print "icecream served".
*
                                **** Main Logic ****
 *create two customer then create constructor with flavor and icecreamtype. and one empty constructor also use setters
 * if(customer is cone)
     * then create known cone and perform ordreIcecream with cone
     * convey the order id and price to customer
 *if(customer is cup)
    *  create empty cup and set falvor and price.perform ordreIcecream with cup
      * convey the order id and price to customer
*  print customer1 price and orderid with getter
* print customer2 price and orderid with getter

           **** Version 2 ****
*problem :
      * every time customer to main to cone /cup to get details and vice versa
*solution
     * make customer aware of cone /cup and vice versa
*Passenger changes remove orderId ,price \\\ add cone and cup (getter/setter)
* cone &cup changes remove falvour \\ add customer (getter/setter)

                **** mainlogic ****
*if (customer is cone)
   * create known cone and perform ordreIcecream with cone
   * share the address with cone to customer and vise versa
 *if(customer is cup)
  *  create empty cup and set falvor and price.perform ordreIcecream with cup
  *  share the address with cup to customer and vise versa
*after this we should create abstract class for cone and cup .Name it as icecream.
